# GREGOR

This is an implementation of the GREGOR method.

## Stages

The GREGOR method is broken into 3 stages:

* Gathering a list of globally-significant SNPs from the clumping output of the ancestry-specific, meta-analysis performed in Bottom Line method and writing those out to `out/gregor/snps`.

* Running GREGOR. The regions input to GREGOR are the merged, partitioned regions generated by the LDSC method. And, since the SNPs being input have already been clumped by LD then `LDWINDOWSIZE` parameter passed to GREGOR is set to 1 in an attempt to improve performance.

* Loading all the summary statistics generated by GREGOR for every phenotype/ancestry pair together into a single frame and writing them to `out/gregor/enrichment`.
